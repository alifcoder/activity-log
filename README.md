---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### Logging a manual activity

```php


ActivityLogger::log(new ActivityLogCreateDTO(
                log_type: 'custom',         // optional: log type
                user_id: 1,                 // optional: user_id
                url: 'http://example.com',  // optional: URL
                method: 'GET',              // optional: HTTP method
                request_body: '{}',         // optional: request body
                response_body: '{}',        // optional: response body
                ...                         // other parameters
        ));
```

## 🔀 Logging for Specific Routes

If you want the activity logger to run **only for selected routes**, you may attach the middleware manually:

```php
Route::post('/example', ExampleController::class)->middleware('activity_log');
```

---

## 🔐 Encrypted Request & Response Storage

All logged request and response bodies are stored as **encrypted files** for maximum data protection.

To read an encrypted stored file:

```php
use Alif\ActivityLog\Facades\FileStorage;

$content = FileStorage::readEncrypted($this->request_body);
```
---
## 🔑 Generating an Encryption Secret Key

Since request/response data is encrypted, the package requires a secret key.

Generate it using:

```bash
php artisan activity-log:generate-key
```

---
## 🌍 IP Address Details Sync

The package supports collecting additional information about user IP addresses, such as:

- Country
- City
- Coordinates
- ISP
- ASN
- and more

After installation, the package automatically registers a scheduled task:

```bash
php artisan activity-log:sync-ip-details
```
---

## 🧹 Pruning Old Logs

To automatically delete old or unnecessary logs, the package provides pruning support.

Add the following to your application's scheduler:

```php
$schedule->command('model:prune', [
    '--model' => [Alif\ActivityLog\Models\ActivityLog::class],
])->daily();
```

---

```bash
php artisan activity-log:uninstall

## 📡 Automatic Logging for All Requests

To log **every request** made to your Laravel application, you can use the provided middleware and HTTP macro.

### ✅ 1. Register the Middleware

In your `app/Http/Kernel.php`, register the middleware globally or per group:

```php
protected $middleware = [
    // ...
    \Alif\ActivityLog\Http\Middleware\ActivityLogMiddleware::class,
];
```

This will automatically log incoming HTTP requests, including route, URL, method, and user info.

### ✅ 2. Log Outgoing HTTP Requests

The package extends Laravel’s `Http` client with a `loggable()` macro.

Example usage:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

$response = Http::loggable()->get('https://example.com/api/data');
```

This logs outgoing HTTP calls made by your application.

---

## 🧩 Customization

You can customize what gets logged, ignored routes/methods, and the database connection via:

```
config/activity-log.php
```
